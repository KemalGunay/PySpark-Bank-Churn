* **EstimatedSalary**: as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
* **Exited: (Dependent Variable)**: whether or not the customer left the bank.

## Acknowledgements
As we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one.

It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.

Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.
